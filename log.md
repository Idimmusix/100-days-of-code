# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: started building a local library app with django while following this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models) in my quest to t
become a better django programmer .

**Thoughts:** Django is my first experience with python, so I am trying hard to understand the python part of the app.
